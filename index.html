            All of the lights (all of the lights)
            (Lights, lights) all of the lights
            Turn up the lights in here baby
            Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
            Turn up the lights in here, baby
            You know what I need
            Want you to see everything
            Want you to see all of the lights
            Fast cars, shooting stars
            (All of the lights, all of the lights)
            Until it's Vegas everywhere we are
            (All of the lights)
            If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life
            If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life
            Something wrong
            I hold my head
            M.j. Gone, our nigga dead!
            I slapped my girl, she called the feds
            I did that time and spent that bread
            I'm heading home, I'm almost there
            I'm on my way, headed up the stairs
            To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
            I had to take 'em to that ghetto university (all of the lights)
            Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
            Strobe lights, street lights
            (All of the lights, all of the lights)
            Fast life, drug life
            Thug life, rock life
            Every night (all of the lights)
            Turn up the lights in here, baby
            Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
            Turn up the lights in here, baby
            You know what I need, want you to see everything
            Want you to see all of the lights
            Restraining order
            Can't see my daughter
            Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
            Public visitation
            We met at Borders
            Told her she take me back
            I'll be more supportive
            I made mistakes
            I bumped my head
            Courts suck me dry
            I spent that bread
            She need her daddy
            Baby please,
            Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university (all of the lights)
            Cop lights, flash lights, spot lights
            Strobe lights, street lights
            (All of the lights, all of the lights)
            Fast life, drug life
            Thug life, rock life
            Every night (all of the lights)
            Turn up the lights in here, baby
            Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
            Turn up the lights in here, baby
            You know what I need, want you to see everything
            Want you to see all of the lights
            Getting mine, baby
            Gotta let these niggas know, yeah
            Get right, ay
            You should go and get your own
            Getting mine, baby
            Gotta let these niggas know, yeah
            Get right, ay
            You should go and get your own
            Unemployment line, credit card declined
            Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind? (My mind, my mind, my mind)
            And also was about to do that line (line, line, line)
            Okay, okay, you know we going all the way this time (time)
            We going all the way this time (time)
            We going all the way this time
            We going all the way this time
            We going all the way this time
